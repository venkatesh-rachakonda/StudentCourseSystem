Student Course Management System

This is a simple Java console application that I created to practice basic concepts like classes, file handling, and user input. The program allows students to register and enroll in courses, while an admin can manage the list of available courses.

Features:

- Students can register with an ID and name
- Students can view available courses
- Students can enroll in courses
- Students can view their enrolled courses
- Admin can add new courses
- Admin can view all available courses

Technologies Used:

- Core Java (OOP concepts)
- File handling using text files
- Menu-driven system using loops and switch-case

How to Run:

1. Make sure Java is installed on your system
2. Open Command Prompt or Terminal
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Compile the code using: javac *.java
5. Run the program using: java StudentManagementSystem

Admin Password: admin123

This project helped me understand how to use multiple classes in Java, work with text files for storing data, and implement basic login and menu systems. I plan to improve this project in the future by adding a GUI or connecting it to a database.
